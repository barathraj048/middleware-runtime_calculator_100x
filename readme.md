# Request Time Tracker in Node.js with Express

This project demonstrates how to calculate the amount of time taken to complete the request-response cycle in an Express server. It uses middleware to log the duration of requests, giving insight into server performance and response times.

## Features

- Logs the time taken to process each request.
- Measures response times for all HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.).
- Displays the result in milliseconds for high accuracy.
- Easy to integrate into any existing Express application.
- Helps in performance monitoring and debugging.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/request-time-tracker.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd request-time-tracker
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

1. Start the server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

2. By default, the server will start on port `3000`. You can visit `http://localhost:3000` or any defined route to test the response time tracking.

3. The request duration will be logged to the console, showing the time in milliseconds for each request.

## How It Works

The core idea of this project is to use Express middleware to measure the time taken to process a request. The middleware captures the time when the request is received and again when the response is sent, calculating the difference:

1. **Start Time**: Captured at the beginning of the request.
2. **End Time**: Captured just before sending the response.
3. **Duration**: Calculated by subtracting the start time from the end time.

### Middleware Example:

```javascript
app.use((req, res, next) => {
    const start = Date.now();
    res.on('finish', () => {
        const end = Date.now();
        const duration = end - start;
        console.log(`Request to ${req.path} took ${duration}ms`);
    });
    next();
});
```

## Example

Once the server is running, you can make requests to any route. Here's an example using `curl`:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000
```

Output:

```bash
Request to / took 45ms
```

This shows that the request to the `/` route took 45 milliseconds to process.
